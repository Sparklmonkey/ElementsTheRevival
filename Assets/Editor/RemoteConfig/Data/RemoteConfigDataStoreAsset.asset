    Long time no update. It's been a crazy end of year. But we are going to start

    to start work on PvP, so I am slowly migrating some of the backend services I
    have developed over to Unity. This will help make the implementation of PvP a
    lot smoother and easier to complete. With this Release I have migrated: <br><br>
    - Game News, like this one :D <br> - App Controls, like Maintenance checks, app
    update checks. <br><br><br>I hope to move Player Save Data over next, and then
    from there I can move T50 and create a seasonal system that refreshes every month,
    Achievements that actually work, etc. <br><br>I appreciate you're patience and
    support in this development. And of course, any doubts, concerns or feedback,
    feel free to let me know in discord, or via email. <br><br>Sparklmonkey\",\n
