# ElementsPlasticSync
Mirror of my private repository of the Elements The Revival game. 

This is a public copy of the source for my attempt at reviving Elements the Game. Any feedback or suggestions are always welcome :)

I am currently using Unity 2023.2.11f1 to work on this project. I plan on migrating to Unity 6 soon so I can start using the Behaviour graphs to help with Ai behaviour.

In the ApiManager.cs there is a compile flag that will use a localhost url for the API calls, you can delete that and set it to the elementstherevival url.

When testing the game, always start at the SplashScreen scene. This is where all the singletons/managers are loaded and the api calls start.

Bugs are being tracked in Milanote, along with Version releases and notes:
